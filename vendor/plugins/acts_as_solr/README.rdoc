= acts_as_solr Rails plugin

This plugin adds full text search capabilities and many other nifty features from Apache's Solr[http://lucene.apache.org/solr/] to any Rails model.
It was based on the first draft by Erik Hatcher.

== Current Release

There is no numbered release yet, but the master branch is always considered stable.

== Support

Check the project website[http://mattmatt.github.com/acts_as_solr] or stop by the Google Group[http://groups.google.com/group/acts_as_solr]. Send bug reports through GitHub[http://github.com/mattmatt/acts_as_solr/issues].

== Changes

Please refer to the CHANGELOG[http://github.com/mattmatt/acts_as_solr/blob/master/CHANGE_LOG]

== Installation

For Rails >= 2.1:

     script/plugin install git://github.com/mattmatt/acts_as_solr.git

For Rails < 2.1:

     cd vendor/plugins
     git clone git://github.com/mattmatt/acts_as_solr.git
     rm -rf acts_as_solr/.git

Make sure you copy vendor/plugins/acts_as_solr/config/solr.yml to your Rails
application's config directory, when you install via git clone.

== Requirements

* Java Runtime Environment(JRE) 1.5 aka 5.0 [http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp)
* If you have libxml-ruby installed, make sure it's at least version 0.7

== Configuration

Basically everything is configured to work out of the box. You can use `rake solr:start` and `rake solr:stop`
to start and stop the Solr web server (an embedded Jetty). If the default JVM options aren't suitable for
your environment, you can configure them in solr.yml with the option `jvm_options`. There is a default
set for the production environment to have some more memory available for the JVM than the defaults, but
feel free to change them to your liking.

== Basic Usage

# Just include the line below to any of your ActiveRecord models:
  acts_as_solr

# Or if you want, you can specify only the fields that should be indexed:
  acts_as_solr :fields => [:name, :author]

# Then to find instances of your model, just do:
  Model.find_by_solr(query) #query is a string representing your query

# Please see ActsAsSolr::ActsMethods for a complete info

== acts_as_solr in your tests

To test code that uses acts_as_solr you must start a Solr server for the test environment. You can do that with 

    rake solr:start RAILS_ENV=test

However, if you would like to mock out Solr calls so that a Solr server is not needed (and your tests will run much faster), just add this to your `test_helper.rb` or similar:

    class ActsAsSolr::Post
      def self.execute(request)
        true
      end
    end
