* 1 July 2008: Switched to a different jQuery autocomplete plugin to be used with this plugin.  The previous plugin was not handling case insensitivity, was slow, and lacked various other options.  The new jQuery autocomplete plugin this depends on his a nice improvement, being massively faster, providing a CSS style you can use while your AJAX request runs, handling case properly, and adding a slew of options.
