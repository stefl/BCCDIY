BrainBuster changelog
=====================

HEAD (working towards 0.9)
* TODO: integration testing against Rails

0.8.2
* use direct ivar assigned, not assigns, as assigns is broken in Rails 2.2+
* .html.erb, not .rhtml
* convert to new style describe/it in specs
* fix tests for Rails 2.1 and the view path changes
* ignore case sensitivity in string answers

0.8.1 2008/02/22
* use append_view_paths instead of directly appending to it, for edge rails compatibility [Hashrocket]
* remove #send for 1.9 compatibility

0.8.0 2008/02/12
* clean up all over the place
* fix for Rails 2 compatibility - return false doesn't halt the filter chain
* rename brain_buster_error_message to brain_buster_failure_message
* change captcha_failure so it just places failure message into the flash, and also render :text's it -- you must override render_or_redirect_for_captcha_failure to handle failure yourself in a smarter way!
* change captcha failure to *only render the failure message text* -- you have to handle failure yourself for a better user experience!
* move to github
* move project tracking to Relevance open source trac

0.7.2 (never officially released)
* add a default salt to make setup easier
* add info on the salt to readme
* rename BrainBusterFilters to BrainBusterSystem, since it has more then just filters in it
* more test cleanup

0.7
* move code to google code hosting, so that there is actual infrastructure in place besides a page on my blog
* add the MIT license -- this was always the license, just forgot to include the file
* add mocha and test/spec as requirements for the test suite
* update old tests to use test/spec and stub out AR, so we don't need a database
* major functionality overhaul, using fine grained filters (in BrainBustersSystem) instead of a method you need to call from w/i your controller
* add a new salting of the cookie values, set via @controller.brain_buster_salt= or ApplicationController.brain_buster_salt=.
* moved config options to be class level methods (using class variables) in ActionController
* add a big warning that the next release will remove the "BrainBustersMixin" and "BrainBustersFilter" 
    - you should convert to using the fine grained filters if you want keep up with the latest version
    - see the readme for more details

0.6 (not official released)
* change naming to follow 1.2 -> ie "BrainBusterMixin" became "BrainBustersHelper"
* seperate out the filter
* seperate out the captcha credit into _captcha_footer partial
* move partials to a views folder, it makes more sense
* tweak css

0.5
* first public release

TODOs (someday/maybe)
* ensure backwards compatible with rails 1.2.6
