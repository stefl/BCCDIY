Description:
    The BrainBuster migration generator creates a migration for the BrainBuster model.

    The generator takes a migration name as a first argument.  The migration name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score.  'add_brain_buster' is the default.
    
    The generator creates a migration class in db/migrate prefixed by its number
    in the queue.

Example:
    ./script/generate brain_buster_migration add_brain_buster

    With 4 existing migrations, this will create an AddBrainBuster migration in the
    file db/migrate/5_add_brain_buster.rb
