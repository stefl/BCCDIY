== cache_fu

A rewrite of acts_as_cached.

== Changes from acts_as_cached 1

- You can no longer set a 'ttl' method on a class.  Instead,
  pass :ttl to acts_as_cached:
    >> acts_as_cached :ttl => 15.minutes

- The is_cached? method is aliased as cached?

- set_cache on an instance can take a ttl
    >> @story.set_cache(15.days)
