Cached Resource
===============

Transparently caches ActiveResource data in a memcached instance by extending cache_fu.

Requires cache_fu
http://errtheblog.com/posts/57-kickin-ass-w-cachefu

Configuring the connection to memcache is done through the cache_fu plugin.


Example
=======

This is all you need:

  class MyClass < ActiveResource::Base
    self.site = MY_SITE
    cached_resource
  end


Now every time you run a find it will hit the cache first then do the rest query.  When retrieving collections, individual objects in the collection will be cached separately.

The cached_resource call also takes normal cache_fu options:

  cached_resource :ttl => 15.minutes
